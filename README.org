* Crystalball, Patented Java UI, 1999

** Patent
http://www.google.com/patents/US6628304

** Modules
   I am reworking this code to work with Java Modules, under
   Java 11. So this branch will remain seperate from the main
   branch, which will remain a "historical artifact".

** TODO To Run (to be updated)
- Fork this code
- cd to the root of this project.
- Compile it with
  ant bubble

- Run it with

  ./demo_bubble

- A Swing window should appear, with the heirarchial Bubble interface
  and a "bird's eye" view in the lower left corner.

- Click any bubble -- even in the bird's eye view -- and see what happens.

*** Other demos
    I created, since the issuance of this patent, another view algorthm
    that is basically a "fish-eye". It represents an arbitrary-sized network
    as well, but instead of the fractal zooming, it presents a fish-eye view,
    which pushes those items not in focus hyperbolically to the "edge" of
    the fish-eye "circle".

- To see that, run:
  ./demo_rand

  or

  ./demo_people

**** TODO Currently, demo_people is broken. Bit-rot again.  

** Where do we go from here?
   This branch will remain my "plaything", where I might do some enhancements
   on this code as I see fit. No promises. One thing I might do is re-write this
   in Kotlin!

** History

   This code is mostly unaltered from when I wrote this back in 1999. Except
   I eliminated most of the "bit-rot" due to various API interfaces being
   deprecated, etc.
   
   I sold the patent for this code to Cisco Systems, which was issued in 2003. The
   bird's eye view was Bainbridge's only contribution. David is a great guy
   and Software Engineer working at Cisco at the time.
   
   Even a small contribution means that contributor must be listed on the patent
   by patent law. Quite literally, as I was demoing this to him in my cubicle 
   (remember those?), he suggested it and I spent 30 minutes or so implementing 
   it.

   Around 2007 or so, Cisco used my patent in a counter-suit against another
   large network company who was being used on another patent infringement.
   I was paid a large amount of money to be the expert consultant on my patent,
   and thus "enjoyed" a brief foray into the world of patent law and overly-paid
   lawyers in high-rise buildings, such as the one at 60 State Stret in Boston.
   
   The lawyers had little interest in the math and algorithms this code embraces.
   Instead, they paid far more attention to THE COMMENTS in my code, and made
   big huey over specific wordings on things completely trivial. Ugh. Lawyers.
   
   I "forgot" about this little invention because it is no longer impressive in
   today's mobile app and HTML5/D3/Qt world. But I didn't want it to lapse into
   complete obscurity, so I "dug it up" and put it here as open source.

** Legal Whatever

   Feel free, if you like, to use this code as you see fit. Download it, multilate
   it, print it up on spocket-fed paper and use it as toilet paper. I don't care.

   If you are a small guy like I am, Cisco is not likely to notice. If you are a
   large firm swimming in the same shark-infested warters as Cisco, you might want
   to be careful here, as Cisco's lawyers and hired guns have the awesome power
   to become your living nightmare.
   
   It is my impression that after 15 years patents expire and the IP becomes
   "public domain", but I am NOT a lawyer, nor do I appreciate the even more
   complicated issues and rammafications of International patent law.

** Personal views on Software Patents and other Ramblings

   This might come as a surprise to you, but I am actually against software
   patents. So why do I have this one, you say? Simple. Money. And I was 
   happy to make the many thousands selling this to Cisco and being an
   "expert witness" for the same. Also, as an Autodidact, this represents
   a major "accomplishment" and "milestone" in my past, especially since I 
   have no "degree". No one cares about degrees all that much in my field, anyway.
   What they care about is if you can DO THE JOB. Funny, that.

   From what I've been seeing, the "big sharks" misuse patents anyway, using them
   as "weapons" to beat up on each other. Lawyers get fat, the winning corps
   make more money, and little guys get crushed if they get caught up in the
   fracas. I am all for innovation and the FREEDOM to use it, regardless of any
   "prior art" Schei√üe. And now that I have experienced and been a part of the
   patent wars, I am even more so.

   Fortunately, the chances little guys will be impacted is minimal. Today's world
   of GUIs and UI/UX has gone to a entirely new level that was only a dream
   16 years ago. If I were doing this interface today, I'd do it differently,
   and for mobiles and the web using HTML5 and Javascript with one or more
   frameworks. The animation would be much more fluid and not as rigid as
   this 20-year-old relic is.
